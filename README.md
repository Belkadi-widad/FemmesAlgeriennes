# FemmesAlgeriennes
 We made a static site only in html and pure CSS  
that brings together several Algerian women who made history in 3 different times
(past, present and in the near future) in several different fields: History, Sport and Art and culture (Drawings and Literature)
Our work has been structured as follows:
4 pages having the same template  (Page header (Common header for 4 pages), content and a footer (Common footer for 4 pages)).
- The main page is the home page containing a main hand which gives access to the other pages (access by domain)
- History and Sport pages their content is structured in the same way: a time axis divided according to the character and each character will have
a bibliography with a menu allowing the navigation of its different parts
- Art and culture page: The page is structured a little differently . In addition it contains a menu by area (Drawing, literature) and a gallery section which allows you to view a photo album representing the role of the Algerian woman in the evolution of the various fields of art and culture in time.

Note: Unfortunately it's not a responsive site .
